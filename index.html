        <h1>The Jane</h1>
        <p>The Jane first opened its doors in 2014,
            offering a unique combination of top notch gastronomy made accessible for a broad audience —
            whether young or old, foodies or guests who experience gastronomy for the first time — ever since.
            </br>
            </br>
            The restaurant is set in the former chapel of the Military Hospital.
            The chapel as well as the surrounding site have been completely renovated
            a fter years of emptiness. Piet Boon took care of the restaurant’s design and together
            with various artists and craftspeople he made sure The Jane became a real gem.
            </br>
            </br>
            The Jane is the gastronomic restaurant set on the ground floor and all tables have a
            view onto the open kitchen. There is an extensive wine list that offers both new biological
            wines and golden oldies of renowned wine domains. On the first floor, you can find Jane's Upper Room Bar.</p>
